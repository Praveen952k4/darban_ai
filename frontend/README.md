🔥 **React + Vite + Blink Tic Tac Toe**
  
  This project leverages the React + Vite stack to create an interactive, emoji-powered, and fully responsive Blink Tic Tac Toe game. It utilizes modern frontend tooling with lightning-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and an enhanced developer experience through ESLint integration.

🛠️ **Setup Highlights**
  
  ⚡ Minimal and Fast
  Vite offers a lean setup with out-of-the-box support for React and blazing-fast HMR—ideal for quick iteration during development.
  
  🔌 Plugin Flexibility
  @vitejs/plugin-react (uses Babel for Fast Refresh)
  
  @vitejs/plugin-react-swc (uses SWC for even faster builds)
  
  🧹 Linting Support
  Built-in ESLint rules help enforce code quality and consistency throughout the project.
  
  🚀 Production-Ready Recommendations
  For scalability, TypeScript with typescript-eslint is ideal for type-aware linting and improved maintainability. The Vite + TS template is a great place to start.
